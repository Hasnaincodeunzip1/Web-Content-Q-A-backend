from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here (if you had any).
# We're not using the Django admin for this project, so this file remains
# mostly empty.  If you later added models and wanted them to appear in the
# Django admin interface, you would register them here.

# Example (if you *did* have a model named 'MyModel'):
# from .models import MyModel
# admin.site.register(MyModel)
